  <h3>Hello World of Object Recognition!</h3>
 <h2>Aim:</h2> To make a convolution neural network to recognise handwritten digits by training the model on MNIST dataset available in keras.
 <br>
 <h2>MNIST DATASET:</h2>The training dataset contain 60000 images and testing contain 10000 images .Each image is 28x28 pixel and grey scale.
  <br>
 <h2>CNN MODEL OVERVIEW:</h2>
 <br>⚈ It is a 17 layer model with Conv2D,MaxPooling2D,BatchNormalization,Dense,Flatten and Dropout layer combination.
 <br>⚈ Input layer has 32 neuron and output layer has 10 neurons as 10 different clases exsist.
 <br>⚈ 30 epochs are used.
 <br>⚈ Categorical_loss is loss function and adam is used for optimization.
 <br>⚈ Model gives 99.15% accuracy.
<h2>For Deployment:</h2>Save model using tensorflowjs converters as json file and weight as .h5 file.Use Tensorflow.js to load model and predict in javascript file
